# XRechnung EN 16931 Guide

This repository provides documentation and examples of how Mascot delivers invoices in **XRechnung (EN 16931)** format.

---

## Overview

XRechnung is the German standard for electronic invoicing based on the **European Norm EN 16931**.  
It is typically required for **B2G (Business-to-Government)** invoicing but is also used for **B2B** integrations where structured electronic invoices are needed.

Mascot generates fully compliant **XRechnung invoices** and can deliver them through multiple secure channels.
